# Installation
As this repository is not yet added in the default HACS repository you have to add the repository beforehand.

1. Go to the HACS Tab
2. Click on the three dot menu in the top right and select Custom repositories
3. Add ```https://github.com/Ronjar/beszel-ha```
4. Restart HomeAssistant
5. Go to integrations, press Add integration and search for BeszelAPI
6. In the Setup Dialog use the following values
    - *URL*: The root url / IP of your Beszel instance, like beszel.example.com
    - *user*: Either your default admin username / email or (recommended) create another user with the role user and assigning the agents you want to expose to it.
    - *password*: The password to the user
7. The API will pull the data and reload every 2 minutes

# Usage
After installing the following entities will exposed as sensors (more to come):
- Status (Connection)
- Uptime
- CPU
- Disk usage
- Temperature
- RAM

For example if your machine is named *test*, CPU will be available as ```sensor.test_cpu```

# Examples
Here is one of my machines with the entities the integration currently exports

And here one card I created for myself using those sensors:

The YAML for this card layout:
